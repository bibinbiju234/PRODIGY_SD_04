# Sudoku Solver 🔢
This is a python-based Sudoku Solver that uses the backtracking algorithm to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles efficiently. The algorithm fills empty cells in the puzzle by testing valid numbers, backtracking when a conflict arises.

# ⭐ Features :


✔ Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.


✔ Implemented using the backtracking algorithm.


✔ Easy to understand.


# 🛠️ How It Works :


The program checks the puzzle row by row, trying to place numbers (1-9) in empty cells. If a conflict is found, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. This continues until the puzzle is solved or no solution exists.
